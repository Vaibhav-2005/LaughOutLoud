# Laugh Out Loud 😂

**Description:**  
Welcome to **Laugh Out Loud**, the project that’s here to help you level up your Next.js skills while making you chuckle (or at least groan at the bad jokes). 🚀

**Motive:**  
I built this project to get a better grip on the fundamentals of Next.js, because who wouldn’t want to build a site that makes people laugh while learning? It’s like multitasking but with memes. 😎

**Deployed Link:**

Enjoy the ride, improve your Next.js skills, and remember—laughter is the best form of debugging. 😅
